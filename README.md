# EAD Splitter

This is a basic class with a couple functions that will extract items and/or folders as `lxml` objects from EAD XML. I'm assuming that the EAD is generated by ArchivesSpace, but it's probably applicable to other sources (as long as they use the XML namespaces used by ArchivesSpace). 

It takes in a valid EAD `.xml` file and spits out a Python dict like so `{ ITEM_ID : ITEM_AS_LXML_OBJECT }`. You can then do xpath stuff to the object to get things like title, scope & content notes, etc.

There are a couple things here specific to BAMPFA (`cbpf` as part of the `ID`) but it's pretty generic.
